# VueJS project

_This is the front end part of the task._
Vue project was initiated with vite

**What I used**:

- [vueJs](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state.html) with Options API (I thought that's what you meant by the vue2)
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) from utility classes and created custom classes with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) **@apply** function
- [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/) for icons (ProfileView)

I wanted to use more `typescript` features and don't write (any) on few places but I am out of the time.
